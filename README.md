# Bucheronne
Tool to handle branches with the same name over several repos

## Why is it named "Bucheronne" ?
`Bucheronne` means `lumberjack` in French. A repository is a tree because it has branches and this tool can handle multiple repositories/trees so it is like a forest.

## Todo :
* Add user documentation
* Add docstring for functions in `github_branch.py`
